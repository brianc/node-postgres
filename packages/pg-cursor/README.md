node-pg-cursor
==============

Use a PostgreSQL result cursor from node with an easy to use API.

### install

```sh
$ npm install pg-cursor
```
___note___: this depends on _either_ `npm install pg` or `npm install pg.js`, but you __must__ be using the pure JavaScript client.  This will __not work__ with the native bindings.
