node-postgres is a collection of node.js modules for interfacing with your PostgreSQL database. It has support for callbacks, promises, async/await, connection pooling, prepared statements, cursors, streaming results, C/C++ bindings, rich type parsing, and more! Just like PostgreSQL itself there are a lot of features: this documentation aims to get you up and running quickly and in the right direction. It also tries to provide guides for more advanced & edge-case topics allowing you to tap into the full power of PostgreSQL from node.js.

## Install

```bash
$ npm install pg
```

## Supporters

node-postgres continued development and support is made possible by the many [supporters](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres/blob/master/SPONSORS.md).

# Version compatibility

node-postgres strives to be compatible with all recent LTS versions of node & the most recent "stable" version. At the time of this writing node-postgres is compatible with node 8.x, 10.x, 12.x and 14.x To use node >= 14.x you will need to install `pg@8.2.x` or later due to some internal stream changes on the node 14 branch. Dropping support for an old node lts version will always be considered a breaking change in node-postgres and will be done on _major_ version number changes only, and we will try to keep support for 8.x for as long as reasonably possible.

## Getting started

The simplest possible way to connect, query, and disconnect is with async/await:

```js
import pg from 'pg'
const { Client } = pg
const client = new Client()
await client.connect()

const res = await client.query('SELECT $1::text as message', ['Hello world!'])
console.log(res.rows[0].message) // Hello world!
await client.end()
```

### Error Handling

For the sake of simplicity, these docs will assume that the methods are successful. In real life use, make sure to properly handle errors thrown in the methods. A `try/catch` block is a great way to do so:

```ts
import pg from 'pg'
const { Client } = pg
const client = new Client()
await client.connect()

try {
   const res = await client.query('SELECT $1::text as message', ['Hello world!'])
   console.log(res.rows[0].message) // Hello world!
} catch (err) {
   console.error(err);
} finally {
   await client.end()
}
```

### Callbacks

If you prefer a callback-style approach to asynchronous programming, all async methods support an optional callback parameter as well:

```js
import pg from 'pg'
const { Client } = pg
const client = new Client()

client.connect((err) => {
   client.query('SELECT $1::text as message', ['Hello world!'], (err, res) => {
     console.log(err ? err.stack : res.rows[0].message) // Hello World!
     client.end()
   })
})

```

Our real-world apps are almost always more complicated than that, and I urge you to read on!
