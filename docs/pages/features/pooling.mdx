If you're working on a web application or other software which makes frequent queries you'll want to use a connection pool.

The easiest and by far most common way to use node-postgres is through a connection pool.

## Why?

- Connecting a new client to the PostgreSQL server requires a handshake which can take 20-30 milliseconds. During this time passwords are negotiated, SSL may be established, and configuration information is shared with the client & server. Incurring this cost _every time_ we want to execute a query would substantially slow down our application.

- The PostgreSQL server can only handle a [limited number of clients at a time](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Number_Of_Database_Connections). Depending on the available memory of your PostgreSQL server you may even crash the server if you connect an unbounded number of clients. _note: I have crashed a large production PostgreSQL server instance in RDS by opening new clients and never disconnecting them in a python application long ago. It was not fun._

- PostgreSQL can only process one query at a time on a single connected client in a first-in first-out manner. If your multi-tenant web application is using only a single connected client all queries among all simultaneous requests will be pipelined and executed serially, one after the other. No good!

### Good news

node-postgres ships with built-in connection pooling via the [pg-pool](/apis/pool) module.

## Examples

The client pool allows you to have a reusable pool of clients you can check out, use, and return. You generally want a limited number of these in your application and usually just 1. Creating an unbounded number of pools defeats the purpose of pooling at all.

### Checkout, use, and return

```js
import { Pool } from 'pg'

const pool = new Pool()

// the pool will emit an error on behalf of any idle clients
// it contains if a backend error or network partition happens
pool.on('error', (err, client) => {
  console.error('Unexpected error on idle client', err)
  process.exit(-1)
})

const client = await pool.connect()
const res = await client.query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1', [1])
console.log(res.rows[0])

client.release()
```

<Alert>
  <div>
    You must <b>always</b> return the client to the pool if you successfully check it out, regardless of whether or not
    there was an error with the queries you ran on the client.
  </div>
  If you don't release the client your application will leak them and eventually your pool will be empty forever and all
  future requests to check out a client from the pool will wait forever.
</Alert>

### Single query

If you don't need a transaction or you just need to run a single query, the pool has a convenience method to run a query on any available client in the pool. This is the preferred way to query with node-postgres if you can as it removes the risk of leaking a client.

```js
import { Pool } from 'pg'

const pool = new Pool()

const res = await pool.query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1', [1])
console.log('user:', res.rows[0])
```

### Shutdown

To shut down a pool call `pool.end()` on the pool. This will wait for all checked-out clients to be returned and then shut down all the clients and the pool timers.

```js
import { Pool } from 'pg'
const pool = new Pool()

console.log('starting async query')
const result = await pool.query('SELECT NOW()')
console.log('async query finished')

console.log('starting callback query')
pool.query('SELECT NOW()', (err, res) => {
  console.log('callback query finished')
})

console.log('calling end')
await pool.end()
console.log('pool has drained')
```

The output of the above will be:

```
starting async query
async query finished
starting callback query
calling end
callback query finished
pool has drained
```

<Info>
  The pool will return errors when attempting to check out a client after you've called pool.end() on the pool.
</Info>
