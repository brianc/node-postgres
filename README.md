#node-postgres

Non-blocking PostgreSQL client for node.js.  Pure JavaScript and native libpq bindings.  Active development,  well tested, and production use.

## Installation

    npm install pg
    
## Examples

### Simple, using built-in client pool

```javascript
var pg = require('pg'); 
//or native libpq bindings
//var pg = require('pg').native

var conString = "tcp://postgres:1234@localhost/postgres";

//error handling omitted
pg.connect(conString, function(err, client) {
  client.query("SELECT NOW() as when", function(err, result) {
    console.log("Row count: %d",result.rows.length);  // 1
    console.log("Current year: %d", result.rows[0].when.getYear());
  });
});
```

### Evented api

```javascript
var pg = require('pg'); //native libpq bindings = `var pg = require('pg').native`
var conString = "tcp://postgres:1234@localhost/postgres";

var client = new pg.Client(conString);
client.connect();

//queries are queued and executed one after another once the connection becomes available
client.query("CREATE TEMP TABLE beatles(name varchar(10), height integer, birthday timestamptz)");
client.query("INSERT INTO beatles(name, height, birthday) values($1, $2, $3)", ['Ringo', 67, new Date(1945, 11, 2)]);
client.query("INSERT INTO beatles(name, height, birthday) values($1, $2, $3)", ['John', 68, new Date(1944, 10, 13)]);

//queries can be executed either via text/parameter values passed as individual arguments
//or by passing an options object containing text, (optional) parameter values, and (optional) query name
client.query({
  name: 'insert beatle',
  text: "INSERT INTO beatles(name, height, birthday) values($1, $2, $3)",
  values: ['George', 70, new Date(1946, 02, 14)]
});

//subsequent queries with the same name will be executed without re-parsing the query plan by postgres
client.query({
  name: 'insert beatle',
  values: ['Paul', 63, new Date(1945, 04, 03)]
});
var query = client.query("SELECT * FROM beatles WHERE name = $1", ['John']);

//can stream row results back 1 at a time
query.on('row', function(row) {
  console.log(row);
  console.log("Beatle name: %s", row.name); //Beatle name: John
  console.log("Beatle birth year: %d", row.birthday.getYear()); //dates are returned as javascript dates
  console.log("Beatle height: %d' %d\"", Math.floor(row.height/12), row.height%12); //integers are returned as javascript ints
});

//fired after last row is emitted
query.on('end', function() { 
  client.end();
});
```

### Example notes

node-postgres supports both an 'event emitter' style API and a 'callback' style.  The callback style is more concise and generally preferred, but the evented API can come in handy.  They can be mixed and matched.  The only events which do __not__ fire when callbacks are supplied are the `error` events, as they are to be handled by the callback function.

All examples will work with the pure javascript bindings (currently default) or the libpq native (c/c++) bindings (currently in beta)

To use native libpq bindings replace `require('pg')` with `require('pg').native`.

The two share the same interface so __no other code changes should be required__.  If you find yourself having to change code other than the require statement when switching from `pg` to `pg.native`, please report an issue.

### Info

* pure javascript client and native libpq bindings share _the same api_
* _heavily_ tested
  * the same suite of 200+ integration tests passed by both javascript & libpq bindings
  * benchmark & long-running memory leak tests performed before releases
  * tested with with
    * postgres 8.x, 9.x
    * Linux, OS X
    * node 2.x & 4.x
* row-by-row result streaming
* built-in (optional) connection pooling
* responsive project maintainer
* supported PostgreSQL features
  * parameterized queries
  * named statements with query plan caching
  * async notifications
  * extensible js<->postgresql data-type coercion 
* query queue
* active development
* fast
* close mirror of the node-mysql api for future multi-database-supported ORM implementation ease
