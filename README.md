[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/brianc/node-postgres.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/brianc/node-postgres)

PostgreSQL client for node.js.  Pure JavaScript and native libpq bindings.

## Installation

    npm install pg

### Windows
 
 1. Install Visual Studio C++ (successfully built with Express 2010). Express is free.
 2. Add your Postgre Installation's `bin` folder to the system path (i.e. `C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\9.3\bin`).
 3. Make sure that both `libpq.dll` and `pg_config.exe` are in that folder.
 4. `npm install pg`

## Examples

### Client pooling

Typically you will access the PostgreSQL server through a pool of clients.  node-postgres ships with a built in pool to help get you up and running quickly.

To prevent the "leaking" of clients, `done()` must be called at all times to ensure the client is safely released back to the pool.

```javascript
var pg = require('pg');
var conString = "postgres://username:password@localhost/database";

pg.connect(conString, function(err, client, done) {
  if(err) {
    //Release the client back to the pool
    done();
    return console.error('error fetching client from pool', err);
  }
  client.query('SELECT $1::int AS number', ['1'], function(err, result) {
    //Release the client back to the pool
    done();
    
    if(err) {
      return console.error('error running query', err);
    }
    console.log(result.rows[0].number);
    //output: 1
  });
});

```


### Simple

Sometimes you may not want to use a pool of connections.  You can easily connect a single client to a postgres instance, run a query, and disconnect.

```javascript
var pg = require('pg'); 
//or native libpq bindings
//var pg = require('pg').native

var conString = "postgres://username:password@localhost/database";

var client = new pg.Client(conString);
client.connect(function(err) {
  if(err) {
    return console.error('could not connect to postgres', err);
  }
  client.query('SELECT NOW() AS "theTime"', function(err, result) {
    if(err) {
      return console.error('error running query', err);
    }
    console.log(result.rows[0].theTime);
    //output: Tue Jan 15 2013 19:12:47 GMT-600 (CST)
    client.end();
  });
});

```

## Documentation

Documentation is a work in progress primarily taking place on the github WIKI

## Native Bindings

node-postgres contains a pure JavaScript driver and also exposes JavaScript bindings to libpq.  You can use either interface.  I personally use the JavaScript bindings as they are quite fast, and I like having everything implemented in JavaScript.

To use native libpq bindings replace `require('pg')` with `require('pg').native`.  If you __do not__ need or want the native bindings at all, consider using [node-postgres-pure](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres-pure) instead which does not include them.

The two share the same interface so __no other code changes should be required__.  If you find yourself having to change code other than the require statement when switching from `pg` to `pg.native` or `pg.js`, please report an issue.

## Features

* pure JavaScript client and native libpq bindings share _the same api_
* optional connection pooling
* extensible js<->postgresql data-type coercion
* supported PostgreSQL features
  * parameterized queries
  * named statements with query plan caching
  * async notifications with `LISTEN/NOTIFY`
  * bulk import & export with `COPY TO/COPY FROM`

## Contributing

__I love contributions.__

You are welcome contribute via pull requests.  If you need help getting the tests running locally feel free to email me or gchat me.

I will __happily__ accept your pull request if it:
- _has tests_
- looks reasonable
- does not break backwards compatibility
- satisfies jshint

Information about the testing processes is in the [wiki](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres/wiki/Testing).

If you need help or have questions about constructing a pull request I'll be glad to help out as well.

## Support

If at all possible when you open an issue please provide
- version of node
- version of postgres
- smallest possible snippet of code to reproduce the problem

Usually I'll pop the code into the repo as a test.  Hopefully the test fails.  Then I make the test pass.  Then everyone's happy!


If you need help or run into _any_ issues getting node-postgres to work on your system please report a bug or contact me directly.  I am usually available via google-talk at my github account public email address.

I usually tweet about any important status updates or changes to node-postgres.  
Follow me [@briancarlson](https://twitter.com/briancarlson) to keep up to date.
